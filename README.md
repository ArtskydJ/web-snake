### To Do

Here are some improvements that the game needs. They used to be GitHub issues, but they clogged up my [issues list](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3AArtskydJ).

- [ ] Show score during or after the game, and save local high scores.
- [ ] Make the canvas cover the entire body, for a better mobile experience. The initial game launch buttons will have to be hidden during the game.
- [ ] Show instructions on how to play the game. (This item and the one above might be merged into a launch screen.)
- [ ] Make it more obvious when you die.
- [ ] Don't start moving the snake until the user presses a button.
- [ ] Add pause functionality.
